StrengthsFinder 2.0 Parser
==========================

A small Ruby parser for work. Started with a file that listed all staff, all strengths and then a number 1-5 to match staff to strengths. Converted this to a text list of each staff member and their top five strengths in order.

I would include input and output... But my work would probably frown on that info being out there. :)
